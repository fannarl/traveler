# Kingâ€™s Island needs a program for its admission booths. When visitors to the park come up to the booth to purchase their tickets, 
# the worker uses this program to figure out how much to charge them.

# Each ticket cost $30. Senior citizens (age >= 65) are given a 50% discount. Children under (or equal to) the age of 5 get a free admission.
# Write a program that prompts for the visitor's age and computes the ticket price (which should be a float).

age = int(input("Input age: ")) # Do not change this line
prize = float(30)
# Fill in the missing code below
if age >= 65:
    prize = prize * 0.5
    print(prize)
elif age <= 5:
    prize = 0
    print(prize)
else:
    print(prize)
