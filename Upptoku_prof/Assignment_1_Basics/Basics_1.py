# Einstein's famous equation states that the energy in an object at rest equals its mass times the square of the speed of light.  
# (The speed of light is 300,000,000 m/s.)

# Complete the skeleton code below so that it:
# * Accepts the mass of an object (remember to convert the input string to a number, in this case, a float).
# * Calculate the energy, e
# * Prints e

m_str = input('Input m: ')  # do not change this line
# change m_str to a float
m_str = float(m_str)
# remember you need c
c = 300000000
# e =
e = m_str * c ** 2
print("e =", e)  # do not change this line
