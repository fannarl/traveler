The stock market closed out its worst week so
far this year, as prices fell for the second straight session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 44.92 points
Friday to 1,978.95, finishing the week with a net loss of 108.42.
That marked the average's biggest weekly decline since it
dropped 143.74 points last Nov. 30-Dec. 4.
After tumbling Thursday in foreign exchange, the dollar showed
signs of steadying Friday. Interest rates, which had contributed to
the stock market's woes by rising Thursday morning, dropped back a
bit.
But analysts said investors were still leery of stocks. They
said Thursday's selloff dealt a significant blow to the tenuous
confidence that had been building up in the market's rally since
late last year.
In the absence of any news to explain the market's weakness,
brokers said many traders remained fearful that economic and
inflationary pressures might soon reach a point where they would
prompt the Federal Reserve to begin tightening credit.
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 1 in the
daily tally on the New York Stock Exchange, with 385 up, 1,156 down
and 428 unchanged.
Big Board volume came to 163.17 million shares, against 184.91
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index lost
2.42 to 146.58.
As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $39.81 billion, or 1.52
percent, in value.Two Cubic Corp. employees were charged Friday
with falsifying test results on hand-held mine detectors produced
for the Army.
In announcing the indictment, U.S. Attorney Peter Nunez also
said that the San Diego-based defense contractor had agreed to pay
the government $7.25 million to settle a civil suit stemming from
the allegations.
William Bauder, 55, of Tullahoma, Tenn., and Dennis B. Fink, 39,
of San Diego, pleaded innocent in federal court Friday to
conspiracy to defraud the government, making false statements and
submitting false claims for payment.
Each of the 24 counts in the indictment carries a maximum
penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Cubic held a $9 million Army contract to produce and retrofit
more than 8,500 detectors designed to locate mines in arid soil.
The Justice Department said the devices were never used in combat
by American forces.
Fink was the senior associate engineer on the technical staff,
while Bauder was the program manager for Cubic Defense Systems on
the contract signed in 1981.
Before full-scale production could begin, Cubic had to
demonstrate that it could mass produce mine-detectors that worked
as effectively as earlier prototypes, the indictment said.
The indictment alleged that the test results were falsified so
that the mine detectors appeared to function better than they
really did.
As a result of the false information, the indictment said, the
Army gave approval for full-scale production but terminated the
contract in 1984 because of equipment faults.
In the civil suit, prosecutors alleged Cubic knowingly presented
false claims for payment because some company officials were aware
that the detectors had failed the tests.
Under an agreement with the Army, Cubic company will remain a
government contractor.
``Since the events leading to the indictment, Cubic has taken
the necessary steps to avoid a recurrence of similar conduct,''
Nunez said.
